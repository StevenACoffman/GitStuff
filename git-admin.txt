Admins install git client as per user instructions (windows, mac). Linux users should use their favorite package manager, and set up ssh key similarly.

Admins need to create a local account for any added user on leavitt.lsa.umich.edu before following these instructions.

#next step only used the first time an admin makes changes to gitolite:
git clone gitolite@leavitt.lsa.umich.edu:gitolite-admin
#The rest is for every time you update
cd gitolite-admin
git pull
cd keydir
#add the public keys (files named following <uniqname>.pub)
cd ../conf
#edit the gitolite.conf file and add the userids to the relevant group (designer, admin, developer, etc.)
cd ..
git add -A
git commit -am "Added new keys and rights for <uniqname>"
git push origin master
#done!

This is the simplest case. The vignette user has a distinct key per tier, so it has keys organized in subdirectories below keydir, and the keys were generated as vignette@dev, vignette@qa, vignette@prod. The file names are still vignette.pub.
